name of your precious storyteller, and only then,

Eraser, get the Blood OFF the Clocktower.

                   LAW & ORDER

In the criminal justice system, the people are
represented by two separate yet equally important
groups: the town, who investigate crime; and the
evil, who wreak havoc.

These are their stories.
--------------------------------------------------

           INTRODUCTION TO DESTRUCTION

Children of the beast, embrace to scorn and hate
the human race. Consume the light that hugs the
earth and aid the womb in giving birth to a group
that will appear and guide you through this final
year. The dark armies then will come, when the sum
is forty-one.

                  PAIN FOR PLEASURE

The seas have parted. The ending's started. The
sky has turned to black. A killing spree through
eternity, the devil stabs you in the back. It's
midnight now you must escape somehow; torture is
his leisure. Don't try to hide he'll make you
subside as he exchanges pain for pleasure.

                      A DREAM

        In visions of the dark night
        I have dreamed of joy departed -
        but a waking dream of life and light
        hath left me broken-hearted.

        Ah! What is not a dream by day
        to him whose eyes are cast
        on things around him with a ray
        turned back upon the past?

        That holy dream - that holy dream,
        while all the world were chiding,
        hath cheered me as a lovely beam
        a lonely spirit guiding.

        What though that light, through
        storm and night, so trembled
        from afar - what could there be
        more purely brigbht in Thruth's
        day-star?
