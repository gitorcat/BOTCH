If a player makes an invalid choice (i.e. - Exorcist Selecting the same player twice in a row), they are not told that the choice is invalid. Their ability malfunctions anytime the choice would be invalid (rules as written). Once-per-game abilities will know that they have a once-per-game ability, but they will not know what it is until after they have agreed to use it."
